    "Elastic Net regression is a type of linear regression model that combines the properties of both Ridge regression and Lasso regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "In traditional linear regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. \n",

    "\n",
    "Elastic Net regression addresses these limitations by adding two penalty terms to the traditional linear regression cost function. \n",
    "The cost function of Elastic Net regression is a combination of the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms. \n",
    "The L1 regularization promotes sparsity by encouraging some of the regression coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing \n",

    "\n",
    "The key difference between Elastic Net regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge regression and Lasso regression,\n",

    "\n",
    "Sign and Magnitude: The sign of a coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship between the corresponding independent variable and the \n",

    "The magnitude of the coefficient represents the strength of the relationship. Larger coefficients indicate a stronger impact of the variable on \n",

    "Sparsity and Feature Selection: Elastic Net regression encourages sparsity, meaning some coefficients may be exactly zero. This sparsity property\n",
